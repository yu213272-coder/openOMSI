//! The route navigator: a small tilted 3D map in a corner of the screen, after the Route
//! Advisor of Euro Truck Simulator 2, made for a bus driver's duty.
//!
//! * The map turns with the bus and zooms out with speed; the camera looks over the bus
//!   from behind and above, so the road ahead fills the picture.
//! * Roads are drawn from the traffic network's lanes (dark casing, grey surface); the
//!   trip's route from the first stop to the last lies on them with arrows, coloured by
//!   how busy each stretch is (blue empty, green, yellow, red, dark red jammed), and its
//!   stops as markers (the last is a chequered flag).
//! * Leaving the route is noticed after a moment: a way back is searched on the lanes
//!   (Dijkstra, towards any lane of the route still ahead) and drawn instead - the route
//!   is recalculated as often as the driver goes wrong.
//! * Traffic: every AI vehicle near the bus is on the map, and roads whose cars crawl or
//!   stand are tinted amber or deep red (smoothed over seconds, so one car at a red light
//!   is no jam); the route itself takes the colour where it runs into one, and the header
//!   says how long it costs.
//! * The header: speed, the line, passengers aboard, day and time; the next stop with its
//!   distance and whether the bus is early or late; the speed limit sign and signals ahead
//!   on the map.
//!
//! Everything is drawn with `omsi-ui` into a texture of its own (4x MSAA) that the game
//! shows as a premultiplied overlay. Roads are built once per area and kept on the GPU;
//! their width is in metres near the camera and in pixels far away, so zooming rebuilds
//! nothing.
